1. Tried github action with npm start but that means workflow will continuosly run so better is deploy react app using bundled code and with a server (eg: aws)
2. Or referring to <a>https://codeburst.io/deploying-a-react-app-using-github-pages-and-github-actions-7fc14d380796</a>, we can use peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 to deploy static field (bundle) to gh pages.
